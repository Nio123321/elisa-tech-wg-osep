#
# A system is a set of components that act together as a whole to achieve some
# common goal, objective, or end. A system may contain subsystems and may also
# be part of a larger system.
#
# SYSTEM:     Linux Kernel.
# Boundaries: Kernel API, kernel space memory.
#
# A loss involves something of value to stakeholders. Losses may include a loss
# of human life or human injury, property damage, environmental pollution, loss
# of mission, loss of reputation, loss or leak of sensitive information, or any
# other loss that is unacceptable to the stakeholders.
#

Losses:
- Identifier: L-1
  Text: Loss of or damage to elements outside the system (SW elements)
- Identifier: L-2
  Text: Loss of mission (the kernel does not provide correctly it services anymore)
- Identifier: L-3
  Text: Loss of user satisfaction

#
# A hazard is a system state or set of conditions that, together with a
# particular set of worst-case environmental conditions, will lead to a loss.
#
Hazards:
- Identifier: H-1  #availability
  Text: >
    The kernel does not respond to external input.
  Losses: [L-1, L-2, L-3]

- Identifier: H-2 #integrity
  Text: >
    The kernel does not maintain the integrity of the user space.
  Losses: [L-1, L-2, L-3]

- Identifier: H-3 #integrity
  Text: >
    The kernel does not maintain the integrity of kernel data.
  Losses: [L-1, L-2, L-3]

- Identifier: H-4 #integrity
  Text: >
    The kernel violates the system boundaries.
  Losses: [L-1, L-2, L-3]

#
# One way to derive sub-hazards is to ask: What do we need to control to prevent
# this hazard?
# In our case: allocation and deallocation of memory
#
# Note: Sub-hazards only for dynamic memory allocation
