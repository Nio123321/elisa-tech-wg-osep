# OSEP proposed approach

a) Identify and document system scope, losses and hazards

* *Assumed* system context, boundaries of analysis, role of OS, etc
* OS-level losses/hazards that *may* violate a system's safety goals
* Specific to the topic: start simple and elaborate later!

b) Identify and document constraints and mitigations
* Constraints: Criteria that must be satisfied to *prevent* hazard
* Mitigations: To reduce *impact* of hazards that are not prevented

c) Identify and document kernel features or external mechanisms
* To implement OS- or system-level constraints and mitigations
* To be identified and/or investigated by other WGs?

d) Investigate and document processes and tools to:
* Implement constraints or mitigations via engineering processes
* Verify constraints and mitigations (at all levels)
* Validate constraints, mitigations & verification measures in-context
* Identify or provide other evidence to support claims

e) Identify and document claims and use cases
* To illustrate how a+b+c+d might support an in-context safety argument
* Use cases with kernel config(s) and hardware / system dependencies?
